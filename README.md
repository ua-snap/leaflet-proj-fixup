# Scratch repo for investigating a bugfix

This is a temporary repository containing side-by-side identical maps with Leaflet 1.x vs Leaflet 0.7.x to help identify what's going on and fix [this issue](https://github.com/kartena/Proj4Leaflet/issues/149).

There are two HTML files which are loading static copies of the Leaflet stack, 1.x and 0.7.x respectively.  Versions of code used are shown on each page.
